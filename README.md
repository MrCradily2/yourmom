## Gotta Search Em All Website

This is a website that allow you to look up certain thing about the game pokemon, such as the pokemon's abilities. This website allows people to look for pokemon's heigh and weight, the advantages and disadvantages of natures and the type advantages of pokemon types.

## Design Process

i decided to make a relatively simpler website. this website is simple as the main draw is to pull up informaton about the pokemon. 

## Features

There is a navbar that brings users to the pages for searching and the home page.
there are 3 search functions that filter pokemon, shows the advantages and disadvantages of natures and shows the type advantages and disadvantages.
### Existing Features
navbar - allows users to easily navigate the page
Search pokemon by name - allows people to pull up information on pokemon
Search type effectiveness - allows users to pull up informaton on pokemon type advantages and weaknesses
search pokemon nature - allows users to pull up information about pokemon's natures

### Features Left to Implement

a filter system that allows me to filter the pokemon into their special forms

## Technologies Used

Html 
used because it was necessary
CSS
used because it was necessary
PokeApi
used it as i needed an api to replace the fire emblem heroes api as it was not complete

## Testing
1. navbar
    1. Goes to Home Page
    2. Goes to Pokemon by Name
